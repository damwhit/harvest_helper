1,Tomatoes,"Tomatoes are America’s favorite garden vegetable. (Yes, we technically eat the fruit of the tomato plant, but it's used as a vegetable in eating and cooking and, thus, usually categorized in vegetables.) This vine plant is fairly easy to grow and will produce a bumper crop with proper care. Its uses are versatile, however, tomatoes are susceptible to a range of pests and diseases.",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),"Loamy, Acidic pH","Tomatoes can be either determinate(bush) or indeterminate(climbing) varieties. Determinate varieties can be grown without support, and they typically yield all of their fruit in the span of a few weeks. Indeterminate varieties should be staked, trellised, or caged, and pruned for optimal yields. They yield their fruit over a more extended time period. Tomatoes make great neighbors for basil plants in the garden.","Wait 5-6 weeks after the last frost date to transplant outdoors. For optimal germination, keep the soil at around 80-85°F. For earliest crops, set plants out around the last frost date under floating row covers which will protect from frost to about 28°F. If possible, avoid setting out unprotected plants until night temperatures are over 45°F.","Plant in flats, using a soilless peat-based mix instead of potting soil. When the first true leaves develop, it is time to transplant.","Transplant 12-24"" apart for determinate varieties, 24-36"" apart for indeterminate, unstaked varieties, and 14-20"" for staking.","Final plant spacing should be 12 to 24 inches apart in all directions for determinate varitieties, 24-36"" apart for indeterminate, unstaked varieties, and 14-20"" for staking.",Make sure soil remains moist but is well-drained.,Water seedlings with a high-phosphate fertilizer solution for best results.,Indeterminate varieties will need trellised or caged for best growing results.,"Learn the common tomato diseases in your area and try to select the most resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent blossom end rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture.",Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis.,"Leave your tomatoes on the vine as long as possible. The perfect tomato for picking will be firm and very red in color, regardless of size, with perhaps some yellow remaining around the stem. A ripe tomato will be only slightly soft. Pick at the base of the stem.
",Never refrigerate fresh tomatoes. Doing so spoils the flavor and texture that make up that garden tomato taste.
2,Basil,"Basil is a leafy, fragrant annual with a bushy appearance. The most common type of basil is sweet basil; other types include purple basil (less sweet than common basil), Lemon basil (lemon flavor), and Thai basil (licorice flavor). Basil is easy to grow and works well in Italian dishes, but it only grows in the summer, so plan accordingly.",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),Loamy,Tomatoes make great neighbors for basil plants in the garden. Ensure your outdoor site gets 6-8 hours of full sun daily; soil should be moist and well-drained.,"To get a head start, start the seeds indoors 6 weeks before the last spring frost. Plant the seeds/seedlings about 10 to 12 inches apart. After the last frost date, plant the seeds/seedlings in the ground. The soil should be around 70ºF for best growth.","After the last frost date, plant the seeds/seedlings in the ground about ¼-inch deep. Plant the seeds/seedlings about 10 to 12 inches apart.","After the last frost date, plant the seeds/seedlings in the ground about ¼-inch deep. Plant the seeds/seedlings about 10 to 12 inches apart.",They should grow to about 12 to 24 inches in height. Final spacing should be 12-24 inches in all directions.,Make sure soil remains moist but is well-drained.,,Remember to pinch out the flower heads as soon as they appear to make sure that the leaves will continue growing.,"Variety of bacterial and fungal leaf, stem, and root diseases",Aphids,"After the seedlings have their first six leaves, prune to above the second set. Pinch or cut at the base lateral stems to harvest. The best time to harvest is right when the plant starts to bud (before the flowers bloom).","The best method for storing basil is freezing. Freezing will prevent the plant from losing any of its flavor. To quick-freeze basil, dry whole sprigs of basil and package them in airtight plastic bags."
3,Lettuce,"This is a half-hardy vegetable that you can keep growing all season long by planting one small crop at a time. Days to maturity tend to be short. Garden lettuce is far superior, in both taste and vitamin A content, to supermarket brands.",Part Sun,Loamy,"Consider planting rows of chives or garlic between your lettuce to control aphids. They act as “barrier plants” for the lettuce.  Planning your garden so that lettuce will be in the shade of taller plants, such as tomatoes or sweet corn, in the heat of the summer, may reduce bolting as well.","Lettuce is a cool-season crop that grows well in the spring and fall in most areas. Lettuce seedlings will even tolerate a light frost. 45-65°F is the ideal temperature. Start seeds indoors 4 to 6 weeks before last spring frost date for earliest crop. Direct sowing is recommended as soon as the ground can be worked. Snow won’t hurt them, but a desiccating cold wind will. Harden off seedlings for about one week, and transplant outside between 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after last spring frost.",Plant seeds ½ inch deep.,Leaf lettuce: Plant 4 inches apart. Cos and loose-headed types: Plant 8 inches apart. Firm-headed types: Plant 16 inches apart.,Final spacing for Cos and loose-headed types should be 8 inches in all directions and 16 inches for firm-headed types.,"Make sure soil remains moist but is well-drained. Lettuce will tell you when it needs water. Just look at it. If the leaves are wilting, sprinkle them anytime—even in the heat of the day—to cool them off and slow down the transpiration rate.",,You should be able to sow additional seeds every two weeks for a continuous harvest throughout the growing season.,White Mold,"Aphids, Earwigs","Lettuce should be harvested when full size, but just before maturity. You want it young and tender. Before maturity, you can harvest leaf lettuce by simply removing outer leaves so that the center leaves can continue to grow. Butterhead or romaine types can be harvested by removing the outer leaves, digging up the whole plant or cutting the plant about an inch above the soil surface. A second harvest is often possible this way. Crisphead lettuce is picked when the center is firm. It’s best to harvest in the morning before leaves have been exposed to sun.",
4,Carrots,"Carrots are a popular root vegetable that are easy to grow in sandy soil. They are resistant to most pests and diseases, and are a good late season crop that can tolerate frost. Not all carrots are orange; varieties vary in color from purple to white.",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),"Sandy, Neutral pH","Carrots are biennial plants. If you leave them in the ground, the tops will flower and produce seeds the second year.",Plan to plant seeds outdoors 3 to 5 weeks before the last spring frost date.,Plant seeds 3-4 inches apart in rows. Rows should be at least a foot apart.,Transplanting carrots is not recommended.,Final spacing should be 3-4 inches in all directions.,Water at least one inch per week.,,"Gently mulch to retain moisture, speed germination and block the sun from the roots. Soil should be well drained and loose to prevent forking and stunting of the root growth. Carrots taste much better after a couple of frosts. Following the first hard frost in the fall, cover carrot rows with an 18-inch layer of shredded leaves to preserve them for harvesting later.",Aster Yellow Disease will cause shortened and discolored carrot tops and hairy roots. This disease is spread by pests as they feed from plant to plant. Keep weeds down and invest in a control plan for pests such as leafhoppers. This disease has the ability to overwinter.,"Wireworms, Flea Beetles","Carrots are mature at around 2 ½ months and ½ inch in diameter. You may harvest whenever desired maturity is reached.
You may leave mature carrots in the soil for storage if the ground will not freeze.","To store freshly harvested carrots, twist off the tops, scrub off the dirt under cold running water, let dry and seal in airtight plastic bags, and refrigerate. If you simply put fresh carrots in the refrigerator, they’ll go limp in a few hours."
5,Asparagus,"Asparagus is a perennial bulb and stem vegetable that greets us every spring. It may take 2 to 3 years to get started and produce, so patience is needed! But then the plant can be productive up to 20 years, so we think it's worth the wait. Asparagus has male and female plants, with the female plants producing berries. Regions with cool winters are best for this cool-season crop.",Part Sun,"Sandy, Mildly Acidic to Neutral pH","Asparagus does not like to have its feet “wet,” so be sure your bed has good drainage. For that reason, raised beds can be a good place to plant asparagus.",Asparagus is planted in early spring as soon as the soil can be worked. The plant is grown from “crowns” (1-year-old plants).,"Eliminate all weeds from the bed, digging it over and working in a 2- to 4-inch layer of compost, manure or soil mix. Dig trenches of about 6 inches wide and 6 to 12 inches deep.  Some experts believe shallow trenches of 6 inches are best. Create a mound in the trench and plant the crowns 15 to 18 inches apart, spreading the roots over the ridge.",Transplanting asparagus is not recommended.,Final plant spacing should be 15 to 18 inches apart in all directions.,,,"When the trench is filled, add a 4 to 8 inch layer of mulch and water regularly. Do not harvest the spears in the first year, but cut down dead foliage in late fall and side-dress with compost. During the second year, keep the bed thickly mulched, side-dress in spring and early fall, and cut down dead foliage in late fall.","Crown rot, Rust","Asparagus Beetles, Cutworms, Slugs","Asparagus can take three growing seasons to harvest; you may be able to lightly harvest during the second year. In the first year, just let the asparagus go vegetative to give the crown a chance to get well established. Next spring, remove the old fern growth from the previous year, and keep an eye open for the new spears to begin emerging. For the following years, maintain the bed and harvest only the spears thicker than a pencil. Harvest for 2 or 3 weeks. After you harvest, leave the ferns so it can gather nourishment for next year's growth.",
6,Beans,"Pole and bush beans (more commonly called green beans) are a tender vegetable and a great addition to any garden, great eaten fresh off the plant or incorporated into a recipe. Bush beans require less maintenance, so they are easier to grow.",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),Loamy,"Pole beans will grow in a climbing vine and require a trellis or staking. Bush beans will spread up to 2 feet but do not require support. If you like pole beans, an easy support for them is a “cattle panel”—a portable section of wire fence—16 feet long and 5 feet tall. The beans will climb with ease, and you won’t have to get into contorted positions to pick them.","Seeds can be sown outdoors anytime after last spring frost, minimum soil temp is 48°F.","Plant 1 inch deep, a little deeper for sandier soils. Cover soil to warm if necessary. Bush beans: Plant 2 inches apart. For a harvest that lasts all summer, sow beans every 2 weeks. If you’re going to be away, skip a planting.",Do not start seeds indoors; they may not survive transplanting.,Final plant spacing should be 2 to 4 inches apart in all directions.,"Mulch soil to retain moisture; make sure that it is well-drained. Water regularly, from start of pod to set. Water on sunny days so foliage will not remain soaked.",,,"White Mold, Mosaic Viruses, Bean blossoms will drop from the plant if the weather is too hot and too much nitrogen in the soil will prevent pods from setting.","Aphids, Mexican Bean Beetles, Japanese Beetles","Beans are picked at an immature stage, when the seeds inside have not yet fully developed. Look for firm, sizable pods and snap or cut off the plant. Do not tear the plant.","Beans can be kept fresh for at least 4 days, or blanched and frozen immediately after harvesting. Beans can also be canned or pickled."
7,Beets,"Beets are a cool season vegetable crop. This root veggie grows quickly and has many different varieties which showcase deep red, yellow or white bulbs of different shapes. They can survive frost and almost freezing temperatures, which makes them a good choice for northern gardeners and an excellent long-season crop.",Full-Part Sun,"Loamy, Sandy, Neutral pH","A soil pH above 5.5–6 is best, otherwise growth will be stunted. Beets are a good indicator of soil pH. Beets require especially good nutrition and a high phosphorus level to germinate. Go easy on nitrogen however, an excess will cause sprawling greens and tiny bulbs beneath the soil.","Wait until soil reaches 50 degrees before planting. Early crop can be planted in March/April, and late crop anytime from June to September. Successive plantings are also possible as long as the weather doesn’t exceed 75 degrees F. Space plantings about 20 days apart. Winter crops are a definite possibility in Zone 9 and above.","Plant seeds ½ inch deep and 1-2 inches apart. Make sure soil remains moist for germination. In zones with low moisture and rainfall, soak the seeds for 24 hours before planting.",Transplanting beets is not recommended.,"Thinning is necessary, as you may get more than one seedling out of each seed. Thin when they read about 2 inches high by pinching them off. Pulling them out of the ground may disturb the close surrounding roots of nearby seedlings. Established plants should be thinned to 3–4 inches between plants.",Beets need to maintain plenty of moisture.,,"Mulch and water well. Any necessary cultivation should be gentle, beets have shallow roots that are easily disturbed.
",,"Flea Beetles, Leaf Hoppers, Mexican Bean Beetles","Days to maturity tend to be between 50 and 70 for most varieties, although they can be harvested at any time you see fit. If you like larger bulbs, wait longer, but understand they will be tougher and woody. Don’t let greens grow above 6 inches before harvesting. Don’t forget about the tops! Beet greens have a delicious and distinctive flavor, and hold more nutrition than the roots.","Fresh beets can be stored in the refrigerator for 5–7 days. Clipping the tops off beets will keep them fresher for longer. Leave about one inch of stem on each beet, and store the greens separately. Beets can be frozen, canned and pickled."
8,Broccoli,"Broccoli is a cool-season crop that, like spinach, can be grown in the spring or fall. In fact, you may be able to get a continual harvest throughout both seasons if you time planting correctly. A member of the cabbage family, broccoli is rich in vitamins.",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),"Sandy, Mildly Acidic to Neutral pH",,"Broccoli can germinate in soil with temperatures as low as 40ºF. For spring plantings, seed or set transplants 2 to 3 weeks before last spring frost date. If you transplant, assume 10 less days for growth or the “days to maturity” on the seed packet. For fall plantings, seed 85 to 100 days before your average first fall frost. If you live in a warm climate, a fall planting is best, as broccoli thrives in cool weather. Plant seeds in mid- to late-summer in most places.","Broccoli requires full sun and moist, fertile soil that’s slightly acidic. Work in 2 to 4 inches of rich compost or a thin layer of compost before planting. Plant seeds ½ inch deep.",Set transplants slightly deeper than they were grown originally.,"Space plants 12 to 24 inches apart, depending on the side heads you want to harvest. If you overseed, you will need to thin seedlings to 12 inches apart to give room for the broccoli to grow.","Provide consistent soil moisture with regular watering, especially in drought conditions. Some varieties of broccoli are heat tolerant, but all need moisture. Do not get developing heads wet when watering.",,"Roots are very shallow, do not cultivate. Suffocate weeds with mulch.","Downy mildew: Yellow patches on leaves are usually caused by moist weather. Keep leaves as dry as possible with good air circulation. Buy resistant varieties. Nitrogen deficiency: If the bottom leaves turn yellow and the problem continues toward the top of the plant, the plants need a high nitrogen (but low phosphorus) fertilizer or bloodmeal. Blood meal is a quick Nitrogen fix for yellowing leaves.",Aphids: Curling leaves may mean that the plant’s sap is being sucked by insects. Apply soapy water to all sides of leaves whenever you see aphids. Cabbage loopers: Small holes on the leaves between the veins mean small green caterpillars are present. Look at the undersides of the leaves. Hand pick if the problem is small or control with Bacillus thuringiensis. Use a floating row cover just after planting through harvest to prevent caterpillars. Cabbageworms and other worm pests: Treat same as loopers.,"In terms of timing: Harvest broccoli when the buds of the head are firm and tight before the heads flower. If you see yellow petals, harvest immediately. For best taste, harvest in the morning before the soil heats up. Cut the stalk of the main head at a slant, about 5 to 8 inches below the head. Most varieties have side-shoots that will continue to develop after the main head is harvested. You can harvest from one plant for many weeks, in some cases, from spring to fall, if you’re summer isn’t too hot.",
9,Brussels Sprouts,"Brussels Sprouts are a member of the cabbage family, and an excellent source of protein and vitamins. They have a long growing season, and are generally more successful when grown for a fall harvest, as they only increase in flavor after a light frost or two.",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),Neutral pH,,"While starting seeds indoors is recommended, you may also direct sow seeds 4 months before the first fall frost. You may also have luck finding seedlings at a nursery.","If direct sowing seeds, plant ½ inch deep and 2-3 inches apart.",Set transplants slightly deeper than they were grown originally.,Thin plants to 12-24 inches apart when they reach 6 inches tall.,"Mulch to retain moisture and keep the soil temperature cool. Do not cultivate, roots are shallow and susceptible to damage. Protect the plant by mulching with straw or providing a cover if you plan to harvest into the winter.",,Mulch will also help to keep soil temperatures down.,"Clubroot, Downy Mildew, White Mold","Aphids, Flea Beetles","Harvest sprouts from the bottom of the stalk when they reach about 1 inch in diameter. Do not wash the sprouts before storing them, only right before use.",
10,Cabbage,"Cabbage is a hardy, leafy vegetable full of vitamins. It can be difficult to grow; it only likes cool temperatures, and it can be a magnet for some type of pests. By planning your growing season and providing diligent care, you may have two successful crops in one year, both spring and fall. Many varieties are available to suit both your growing conditions and taste preferences.",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),"Loamy, Sandy, Neutral pH",,Start cabbage seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before the last spring frost. Transplant outdoors 2-3 weeks before the last expected frost date. Choose a cloudy afternoon.,Plant seeds at roughly 1.5 times the seed’s diameter.,"When transplants reach 5 inches tall, thin to make sure they are still the desired length apart. (The plants you remove can be transplanted elsewhere in your garden.)","Plant 12 to 24 inches apart in rows, depending on size of head desired. The closer you plant, the smaller the heads.",Keep soil moist with mulch and water 2 inches per week. Mulch thickly to retain regulate soil temperature.,,,Splitting,"Cabbageworms, Aphid, Flea Beetles","Harvest when heads reach desired size and are firm. This will take around 70 days for most green cabbage varieties. Most early varieties will produce 1- to 3-pound heads.  Cut each cabbage head at its base with a sharp knife. After harvesting, bring inside or put in shade immediately. To get two crops from early cabbage plants, cut the cabbage head out of the plant, leaving the outer leaves and root in the garden. The plant will send up new heads—pinch them off until only four or so smaller heads remain. When these grow to tennis-ball size, they’ll be perfect for salad.","Cabbage can be stored in the refrigerator for no more than two weeks, wrapped lightly in plastic. Make sure it is dry before storing. In proper root cellar conditions, cabbage will keep for up to 3 months. See our article on root cellars."
11,Cauliflower,"Cauliflower is a cool-season crop and a descendant of the common cabbage. It is more difficult to than its relatives because it does not tolerate the heat or cold as well. For this reason, cauliflower is usually grown commercially. If you plan to attempt growing cauliflower in the home garden, it requires consistently cool temperatures with temperatures in the 60s. Otherwise, it prematurely “button”—form small button-size heads—rather than forming one, nice white head.",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),"Loamy, Mildly Acidic to Neutral pH",Soil needs be very rich in organic matter; add compost to the soil before planting. Fertile soil holds in moisture to prevent heads from “buttoning.”,"It is best to start cauliflower from transplants rather than seeds. Transplant 2-4 weeks before the average frost date in the spring, no sooner and not much later. Plant fall cauliflower about the same time as fall cabbage. This is usually 6-8 weeks before the first fall frost and also need to be after the temperature is below 75 degrees F.","If you really want to try starting cauliflower from seeds, start the seeds 4 to 5 weeks before the plants are needed. Plant the seeds in rows 3 to 6 inches apart and ¼ to ½ of an inch deep. Do not forget to water the seeds during their germination and growth.","Once seeds become seedlings, transplant them to their permanent place in the garden.",Space the transplants 18 to 24 inches apart with 30 inches between rows.,"Cauliflower requires consistent soil moisture. They need 1 to 1.5 inches of water each week; with normal rainfall, this usually requires supplement watering.",,"Note that the cauliflower will start out as a loose head and it takes time for the head to form. Many varieties take at least 75 to 85 days from transplant. Be patient. When the curd (the white head) is about 2 to 3 inches in diameter, tie the outer leaves together over the head with a rubber band, tape, or twine. This is called blanching, and it protects the head from the sun and helps you get that pretty white color. The plants are usually ready for harvest 7 to 12 days after blanching.","Clubroot, Black Rot","Cabbageworm, Aphids, Harlequin Bugs","When the heads are compact, white, and firm, then it is time to harvest them. Ideally, the heads will grow 6 to 8 inches in diameter. Cut the heads off the plant with a large knife. Be sure to leave some of the leaves around the head to keep it protected. If the heads are too small but have started to open up, they will not improve and should be harvested. If the cauliflower has a coarse appearance, it is too mature and should be tossed.","If you want to store cauliflower, you can put the head in a plastic bag and store it in the refrigerator. It should last for about a week. For long-term storage, you can also freeze or pickle the heads."
12,Celery,"Celery is a long-season crop that can be tricky to grow, some might say, the trickiest of all. It likes fertile soil, cool temperatures, and constant moisture. It will not tolerate heat and can be hard to transplant. Summer crops in the north and winter crops in the south make celery a year-round producer. All the work is worth it when you harvest crunchy, green stalks.",Full-Part Sun,Neutral pH,,"Celery seeds should always be started indoors for the best success rate, 8 to 10 weeks before the average last frost date for your area. For summer gardeners, a late summer direct sowing is possible. Be sure that temps will stay between 55 and 70ºF throughout growing period.","The National Gardening Association recommends soaking seeds in warm water overnight prior to planting, to reduce germination time.  Direct sow seeds ¼ inch deep.","Harden off seedlings before transplanting by reducing water slightly, and keeping them outdoors for a couple hours a day.",Space the seedlings to 10-12 inches apart.,"Celery is a heavy feeder. It also requires lots of water. Make sure to provide plenty of water during the entire growing season, especially during hot, dry weather. If celery does not get enough water, the stalks will be dry, and small. Fertilize regularly. Add mulch as needed, to help retain soil moisture and add nutrients. Tie growing celery stalks together to keep them from sprawling.",,,"Fusarium Wilt, Mosaic Virus","Cutworms, Aphids, Whiteflies","The parts of celery that are harvested are mainly the stalks, which will be above ground. Harvest stalks from the outside in. You may begin harvesting when stalks are about 8 inches tall.","Keep celery in a plastic bag, in the refrigerator. It should be used within two weeks."
13,Chives,"Chives are a perennial member of the onion family that sport beautiful purple flowers. Chives are cool-season, cold-tolerant perennials that are planted in early spring. Be mindful when planting this herb, as it will take over your garden if the flowers are left to ripen (the flowers scatter the seeds). However, this plant is easy to dig up and move if it overwhelms your garden.",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),"Loamy, Sandy","Soil needs to be moist, fertile, rich, and well-draining. Before planting, incorporate 4 to 6 inches of well-composted organic matter. Apply 2 to 3 tablespoons of all-purpose fertilizer (16-16-8) per square foot of planting area. Work compost and fertilizer into the soil to a depth of 6 to 8 inches.","For a head start, start the seeds indoors 8 to 10 weeks before the last spring frost. If you are growing from seed, sow as soon as the soil is workable in the spring.","For the best growth, the soil should be around 60º-70ºF. Plant seeds ¼ inch deep.",Transplants need good growth before being set in the garden.,Final plant spacing should be 4 to 6 inches apart in all directions.,"It is important to give chives consistent watering throughout the growing season for high yields. Moisten the soil thoroughly when watering. Use mulch to conserve moisture and keep the weeds down. Minimal care is needed for fully grown plants. After the flowers bloom, be sure to remove them so that the seeds aren't spread throughout your garden. Remember to divide the plants every 3 to 4 years in the spring. Chives are much more productive if divided regularly. Allow divided plants to grow for several weeks before harvesting.",,,"Bulb rots (caused by soilborne fungi), White rot, Rust",Onion fly,"Harvest chives 30 days after you transplant or 60 days after seeding. Cut the leaves down to the base when harvesting (within 1 to 2 inches of the soil). Harvest 3 to 4 times during the first year. In subsequent years, cut plants back monthly. The chive plant will flower in May or June. (The flowers are edible.)",Use chives when they're fresh or frozen (freeze the leaves in an airtight bag). Dried chives lose their flavor. Store chives in a cool place in a resealable container.
14,Collard Greens,"Collard Greens are a hardy, cool-season green that are part of the cabbage family. They grow best in the spring and fall and can tolerate all fall frosts.",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),"Loamy, Neutral-Mildly Alkaline pH",,You can plant collards anytime from early spring to early summer. If you plant collards late in the summer you can harvest it from fall until the ground freezes in winter.,"Plant the seeds ¼ to ½ inch deep into well-drained, light soil.","Once seeds become seedlings, transplant them to their permanent place in the garden.","After about 2 weeks, thin the seedlings so that they are spaced 8-12 inches apart.  Transplant to 8-12 inches apart",Water the plants regularly but be sure not to overwater them. Mulch the soil heavily after the first hard freeze; the plants may continue to produce leaves throughout the winter.,,,,"Cabbageworms, Flea beetles, Aphids","Collards are ready to harvest when the leaves are about the size of your hand. Pick about one fistful of leaves per harvest. Avoid picking the terminal bud (found at the top center of the plant) because this will help to keep the plant productive. The small, tender leaves can be eaten uncooked and used in salads.",You can store collards as you would any other leafy green; put the kale in a plastic bag and store it in the refrigerator. It should last about 1 week.
15,Cucumbers,"Cucumbers are a warm-season vegetable planted outside in the ground no earlier than 2 weeks after last spring frost date. Most varieties will grow in any amount of space, thanks to the plant's ability to climb. The most common varieties of slicing cucumbers have sprawling vines with large green leaves and curling tendrils. The growth of these plants is fast, and the crop yield is abundant if you care for them properly.",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),"Loamy, Neutral pH","A trellis might be a good idea if you want the vine to climb, or if you have limited space. Trellising also protects the fruit from damage from lying on the moist ground.","Cucumbers are seeded or transplanted outside in the ground no earlier than 2 weeks after last frost date of spring. Cucumbers are extremely susceptible to frost damage; the soil must be at least 65ºF for germination. Do not plant outside too soon! For an early crop, start cucumber seeds indoors about 3 weeks before you transplant them in the ground. They like bottom heat of about 70ºF (21ºC). If you don’t have a heat mat, put the seeds flat on top of the refrigerator or perch a few on top of the water heater.","Sow seeds in rows, 1 inch deep and 6 to 10 inches apart.","Before you plant outside, select a site with full sun.","When seedlings reach 4 inches tall, thin plants so that  they are 1½ feet apart.","When seedlings emerge, begin to water frequently, and increase to a gallon per week after fruit forms. Water consistently; put your finger in the soil and when it is dry past the first joint of your finger, it is time to water. Inconsistent watering leads to bitter-tasting fruit. Water slowly in the morning or early afternoon, avoding the leaves.","If you've worked in organic matter into the soil before planting, you may only need to side-dress your plants with compost. Or, if you wish, use a fertilizer from your garden store which is low nitrogen/high potassium and phosphorus formula and apply at planting, 1 week after bloom, and every 3 weeks with liquid food, applying directly to the soil around the plants. Or, you can work a granular fertilizer into the soil. Do not overfertilize or the fruits will get stunted.","Mulch to hold in soil moisture. If you have limited space or would prefer vertical vines, set up trellises early to avoid damage to seedlings and vines. Spray vines with sugar water to attract bees and set more fruit.","Bacterial Wilt, Mosaic Viruses","Cucumber Beetles, Whiteflies","Harvest regular slicing cucumbers when they about 6 to 8 inches long (slicing varieties). Harvest dills at 4 to 6 inches long and pickles at 2 inches long for pickles. Harvest by cutting or pinching at the base of the fruit. Cucumbers are best picked before they seeds become hard and are eaten when immature. Do not let them get yellow. A cucumber is of highest quality when it is uniformly green, firm and crisp. At peak harvesting time, you should be picking cucumbers every couple of days. Keep them picked. If you don’t, as plants mature, they will stop producing.",Cucumbers are over 90 percent water. Store wrapped tightly in plastic wrap to retain moisture. They will keep for a week to 10 days when stored properly in the refrigerator.
16,Sweet Corn,"Sweet corn is an annual with yellow, white, and bi-colored ears. A long, frost-free growing season is necessary after planting. Sweet corn is wind-pollinated, so it should be planted in blocks, rather than in single rows. Early, mid, and late-season varieties extend the harvest. If you miss the optimal harvest time, corn will go downhill fast as sugars convert to starch.",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),"Loamy, Neutral pH",Corn is picky about its soil. Work in compost the fall before planting and let over winter in the soil. Starting seeds indoors is not recommended.,"Plant seeds outdoors two weeks after the last spring frost date. Make sure soil temperature is above 60 degrees for successful germination. (Up to 65 for super sweet varieties.) In colder zones, the ground can be warmed by a black plastic cover if necessary. Plant seeds through holes.",Plant seeds 1 inch deep and 4 to 6 inches apart. Space rows 30 to 36 inches apart.,Transplanting sweet corn is not recommended.,"When your plants are 3 to 4 inches tall, thin them so they are 8 to 12 inches apart.","Water well at planting time. Soil must be well drained and able to keep consistent moisture. In dry conditions, be sure to keep corn well watered due to its shallow roots. Water at a rate of 5 gallons per sq yard. Mulch helps reduce evaporation.","You may choose to fertilize at planting time, corn is meant to grow rapidly. If you are confident that the soil is adequate, this can be skipped.",,,"Flea Beetles, Cutworms",Harvest when tassels begin to turn brown and cobs start to swell. Kernels should be full and milky.

18,Onion,"Onions are a cold-season crop, easy to grow because of their hardiness. We recommend using onion sets, which can be planted without worry of frost damage and have a higher success rate than direct seed or transplants. Onions grow well on raised beds or raised rows at least 4 inches high.",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),Neutral pH,"Select a location with full sun where your onions won't be shaded by other plants. Soil needs to be well-drained, loose, and rich in nitrogen; compact soil affects bulb development.","Plant onions as soon as the ground can be worked in the spring, usually late March or April. Make sure temperature doesn’t go below 20 degrees F.","Seeding? Onion seeds are short-lived. If planting seeds indoors, start with fresh seeds each year. Start seeds indoors about 6 weeks before transplanting.","Think of onions as a leaf crop, not a root crop. When planting onion sets, don’t bury them more than one inch under the soil; if more than the bottom third of the bulb is underground, bulb growth can be restricted.",Final spacing should be 4-5 inches between each plant and in rows 12-18 inches apart.,"Generally, onions do not need consistent watering if mulch is used. About one inch of water per week (including rain water) is sufficient. If you want sweeter onions, water more. Onions will look healthy even if they are bone dry, be sure to water during drought conditions.",Fertilize every few weeks with nitrogen to get big bulbs. Cease fertilizing when the onions push the soil away and the bulbing process has started. Do not put the soil back around the onions; the bulb needs to emerge above the soil.,"Make sure soil is well-drained. Mulch will help retain moisture and stifle weeds. Cut or pull any onions that send up flower stalks; this means that the onions have “bolted” and are done. When onions start to mature, the tops become yellow and begin to fall over. At that point, bend the tops down or even stomp on them to speed the final ripening process.",,Onion Maggots,"When tops are brown, pull the onions. Be sure to harvest in late summer, before cool weather. Mature onions may spoil in fall weather.","Allow onions to dry for several weeks before you store them in a root cellar or any other storage area. Spread them out on an open screen off the ground to dry. Store at 40 to 50 degrees F (4 to 10 degrees C) in braids or with the stems broken off. Mature, dry-skinned bulbs like it cool and dry, so don't store them with apples or potatoes."
19,Garlic,"Garlic is easy to grow and produces numerous bulbs after a long growing season. It is frost tolerant. Beyond its intense flavor and culinary uses, “the stinking rose” is good in the garden as an insect repellent and has been used for centuries as a home remedy.",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),"Loamy, Mildly Acidic to Neutral pH","Do not plant cloves from the grocery store. They may be unsuited varieties for your area, and most are treated to make their shelf life longer, making them harder to grow. Instead, get cloves from a mail order seed company or a local nursery. Ensure soil is well-drained with plenty of organic matter. Select a sunny spot.","Garlic can be planted in the spring as soon as the ground can be worked, but fall planting is recommended for most gardeners. Plant in the fall and you’ll find that your bulbs are bigger and more flavorful when you harvest the next summer. In areas that get a hard frost, plant garlic 6 to 8 weeks before that frost. In southern areas, February or March is a better time to plant.","Break apart cloves from bulb a few days before planting, but keep the papery husk on each individual clove. Place cloves 4 inches apart and 2 inches deep, in their upright position (the wide root side facing down and pointed end facing up).",Transplanting garlic is not recommended.,Final spacing should be 4-5 inches between each plant,Water every 3 to 5 days during bulbing (mid-May through June).,"Garlic requires adequate levels of nitrogen. Fertilize accordingly, especially if you see yellowing leaves.",Northern gardeners should mulch heavily with straw for overwintering. Mulch should be removed in the spring after the threat of frost has passed. (Young shoots can’t survive in temps below 20°F on their own. Keep them under cover.) Cut off any flower shoots(scapes) that emerge in spring. These may decrease bulb size. A note on garlic scapes: Some folks love cooking the scales as they are delicious.,White Rot,Garlic is a natural pest repellent!,"Harvest time depends on when you plant, but the clue is to look for yellow tops. Harvest when the tops begin to yellow and fall over, before they are completely dry. To harvest, carefully lift the bulbs with a spade or garden fork. Pull the plants, carefully brush off the soil, and let them cure in an airy, shady spot for two weeks. We hang them upside down on a string in bunches of 4 to 6. Make sure all sides get good air circulation.","Once the garlic bulbs are dry, you can store them. Remove any dirt and trim off any roots or leaves. Keep the wrappers on—but remove the dirtiest wrappers. Bulbs should be stored in a cool (40 degrees F), dark, dry place, and can be kept in the same way for several months. Don’t store in your basement if it’s moist! If you plan on planting garlic again next season, save some of your largest, best-formed bulbs to plant again in the fall."

It should last about 1 week.
21,Cantaloupe,"What we commonly refer to as ‘cantaloupe’ is actually not true cantaloupe, rather, a type of muskmelon. (True cantaloupe has a rough, warty rind and is not widely grown or commercially available in the US.) Muskmelons are a heat-loving fruit with a long growing season. Their cultural and growing requirements are very similar to other melons. They have a net-like, tan rind, and sweet orange flesh. The names muskmelon and cantaloupe are used interchangeably. We will use the name cantaloupe for this page to avoid confusion.",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),"Sandy, Mildly Acidic to Neutral pH","Amend soil with compost before planting. Growing the vines in raised rows, known as hills, ensures good drainage and will hold the sun’s heat longer. If you have limited space, vines can be trained to a support such as a trellis.","If you are in a cooler zone, start seeds indoors about a month before transplanting. Cantaloupe vines are very tender and should not be transplanted until all danger of frost has passed.

Handle them gently when you transplant. Add lots of compost to the area before planting and after planting.",Final spacing should be 18 inches between plants on hills about 3 feet apart.,"While melon plants are growing, blooming, and setting fruit, they need 1 to 2 inches of water per week. Water in the morning, and try to avoid wetting the leaves. Reduce watering once fruit are growing. Dry weather produces the sweetest melon. If you’ve had an exceptional amount of rainfall during the ripening stage, this could cause the bland fruit.",Fertilize when vines start growing.,"Mulching with black plastic will serve multiple purposes: it will warm the soil, hinder weed growth and keep developing fruits clean. Row covers are a good idea to keep pests at bay. Blossoms require pollination to set fruit, so be kind to the bees!",Fusarium Wilt,"Aphids, Cucumber Beetles, Squash Borers","When rinds begin to change from green to tan or yellow, the melon is probably ripe, but be careful not to pick too early. Look for a crack in the stem where it attaches to the fruit. This is a sign of ripeness as well. The fruit should be easy to separate from the vine, but if they fall off by themselves they are usually overripe. Harvest melon when vines are dry, and be careful not to damage them.","They will soften after harvesting, but will not continue to sweeten off the vine. Cantaloupe can be stored uncut for 5 or 6 days. If cut, they can last in the refrigerator for about 3 days, wrapped tightly in plastic."
22,Parsnips,"Parsnips, popular with ancient Greeks and Romans, were brought over to the Americas with the first colonists. Although parsnips are biennials, they are usually grown as an annual vegetable. Parsnips are a hardy, cool-season crop that is best harvested after a hard frost.

23,Peas,"Peas are a cool-season crop, now coming in three separate varieties to suit your garden and cooking needs. They are: Pisum savitum, which includes both garden peas (sweet pea, inedible pod) and snow peas (edible flat pod with small peas inside) and Pisum macrocarpon, snap peas (edible pod with full-size peas). They are easy to grow, but with a very limited growing season. Furthermore, they do not stay fresh long after harvest, so enjoy them while you can!",Full-Part Sun,"Loamy, Neutral pH","To get the best head start, turn over your pea planting beds in the fall, add compost to the soil, and mulch well. As with other legumes, pea roots will fix nitrogen in the soil, making it available for other plants.","Sow seeds outdoors 4 to 6 weeks before last spring frost, when soil temperatures reach 45 degrees F. Get them in the ground while the soil is still cool but do not have them sit too long in wet soil. It’s a delicate balance of proper timing and weather conditions.

Peas are best grown in temperatures below 70 degrees F.",Plant 1 inch deep (deeper if soil is dry) and 2 inches apart.,Transplanting peas is not recommended.,Final spacing should be 3 inches between each plant.,"Water sparsely unless the plants are wilting. Do not let plants dry out, or no pods will be produced.","Be sure, too, that you don’t fertilize the soil too much. Peas are especially sensitive to too much nitrogen, but they may like a little bonemeal, for the phosphorus content.","For tall and vine varieties, establish poles or a trellis at time of planting.",Fusarium Wilt,"Aphids, Mexican Bean Beetles",Keep your peas well picked to encourage more pods to develop. Pick peas in the morning after the dew has dried. They are crispiest then. Always use two hands when you pick peas. Secure the vine with one hand and pull the peas off with your other hand.,"Peas can be frozen or kept in the refrigerator for about 5 days. Place in paper bags, then wrap in plastic. If you missed your peas’ peak period, you can still pick, dry, and shell them for use in winter soups."

Use a sharp knife or scissors to cut peppers clean off the plant for the least damage.",Peppers can be refrigerated in plastic bags for up to 10 days after harvesting.
25,Potatoes,"This half hardy vegetable is a culinary staple, and yet is overlooked by many backyard gardeners. The taste and texture of home-grown potatoes are far superior to store bought, especially the early varieties. They need a cool climate, and also need to be watched to prevent sunburn. Potatoes can be grown as a winter crop in warmer climate zones.",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),"Sandy, Acidic pH","If you are cutting up potato pieces for planting, do so a 1-2 days ahead of time.

Hoe the dirt up around the base of the plant in order to cover the root as well as to support the plant. Bury them in loose soil. The idea is to keep the potato from getting sunburned, in which case they turn green and will taste bitter. You will need to hill potatoes every couple of weeks to protect your crop.",Early/Late Blight,"Aphids, Flea Beetles, Leaf Hoppers","Dig potatoes on a dry day. Dig up gently, being careful not to puncture the tubers. The soil should not be compact, so digging should be easy. New potatoes will be ready for harvest after 10 weeks, usually in early July. You should harvest all of your potatoes once the vines die (usually by late August), or the potatoes may rot.","Make sure you brush off any soil clinging to the potatoes, then store them in a cool, dry, dark place. The ideal temperature for storage is 35 to 40°F. Do not store potatoes with apples; their ethylene gas will cause potatoes to spoil."
26,Pumpkins,"Whether you use them for carving or cooking, pumpkins do not disappoint. Note that pumpkins do require a lot of food and a long growing season (generally from 75 to 100 frost-free days) so you need to plant them by late May in northern locations to early July in extremely southern states. Do not plant this tender vegetable until all danger of frost has passed and the soil is warmed as the seedlings will be injured or rot. (See the Almanac.com/Gardening page for frost dates.) That said, pumpkins are easy to maintain if you have the space.",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),Any,Pick a site with full sun (to light shade) and lots of space for sprawling vines. Vine varieties need 50 to 100 square feet per hill. Pumpkins are big greedy feeders. They prefer very rich soil that is well-drained and not too soggy. Mix lots of compost and aged mature into the planting site before you sow seeds or transplant. Pumpkins do best when the seeds are directly planted in the ground.,"If your growing season is very short, seed indoors in peat pots about 2 to 4 weeks before last spring frost. Be sure to harden off before transplanting. Wait until the plant soil is 70ºF or more before sowing seeds. Optimum soil temperature is 95ºF. Pumpkins are very sensitive to the cold.","Plant seeds in rows or “pumpkin hills” which are the size of small pitcher mounds. With hills, the soil will warm more quickly and the seeds will germinate faster. This also helps with drainage and pest control. Prepare the hills in advance with an abundance of compost dug deep into the ground (12 to 15 inches). Plant the seeds 1 inch deep into the hills (4 to 5 seeds per hill).",Seed indoors in peat pots about 2 to 4 weeks before last spring frost. Be sure to harden off before transplanting.,"When the plants are 2 to 3 inches tall, thin to 2 to 3 plants per hill by snipping off unwanted plants without disturbing the roots of the remaining ones. Space hills 4 to 8 feet apart.","Pumpkins are very thirsty plants and need lots of water. Water one inch per week. Water deeply, especially during fruit set. When watering: Try to keep foliage and fruit dry unless it’s a sunny day. Dampness will make rot more likely.",Pumpkins are HEAVY feeders. Regular treatments of manure or compost mixed with water will sustain good growth.,"Use row covers to protect plants early in the season and to prevent insect problems. However, remember to remove covers before flowering to allow pollination by insects! Add mulch around your pumpkins to keep in moisture, suppress weeks, and discourage pests. Remember that pumpkins are tender from planting to harvest. Control weeds with mulch. Do not over-cultivate, or their very shallow roots may be damaged. Pinch off the fuzzy ends of each vine after a few pumpkins have formed. This will stop vine growth so that the plant’s energies are focused on the fruit.","Powdery Mildew, Anthracnose","Aphids, Squash Borers","Your best bet is to harvest pumpkins when they are mature. They will keep best this way. Do not pick pumpkins off the vine because they have reached your desired size. If you want small pumpkins, buy a small variety. A pumpkin is ripening when its skin turns a deep, solid color (orange for most varieties). When you thumb the pumpkin, the rind will feel hard and it will sound hollow. Press your nail into the pumpkin’s skin; if it resists puncture, it is ripe. To harvest the pumpkin, cut the fruit off the vine carefully with a sharp knife or pruners; do not tear. Be sure not to cut too close to the pumpkin; a liberal amount of stem (3 to 4 inches) will increase the pumpkin’s keeping time.","Pumpkins should be cured in the sun for about a week to toughen the skin and then stored in a cool, dry bedroom or cellar—anywhere around 55ºF."
27,Radishes,"Radishes are a hardy, cool-season vegetable that can produce many crops each season due to its rapid days to maturity. Radishes can be planted in both the spring and the fall, but growing should be suspended in the warmer months. They are a very easy vegetable to grow.",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),Any,Radishes need sun. If they are planted in too much shade—or even where neighboring vegetable plants shade them—they put all their energy into producing larger leaves.

It does best where the average temperature falls below 40ºF in the winter and below 75ºF in the summer.",Plant one-year rhubarb crowns in early spring as soon as the ground is workable when the roots are still dormant and before growth begins or plants are just beginning to leaf out. Rhubarb can also be planted in the fall after dormancy has set in.,Growing Rhubarb from seed is not recommended.,"Dig large bushel basket-size holes. Space rhubarb plants about 4 feet apart and plant the roots 1 to 2 inches below the surface of the soil. Be sure to mix compost, rotted manure, or anything high in organic matter in the soil. Rhubarb plants are heavy feeders and need this organic matter. Don't add a chemical fertilizer when planting rhubarb or during the first year of growth. Direct contact with nitrates can kill your rhubarb plants.",Final plant spacing should be 4 feet apart in all directions.,Water your plant well. It needs sufficient moisture during the summer.,"After the first spring, apply a light sprinkling of a high-nitrogen fertilizer (25-3-3 or 10-6-4) when the ground is thawing or has just thawed, so that the fertilizer will go into the ground and not harm the roots.","Mulch generously with a heavy layer of straw and cow manure to provide nutrients for the plant, retain moisture, and discourage weeds. Remove seed stalks as soon as they appear. Dig and split rhubarb roots every 3 to 4 years. Divide when plants are dormant in early spring (or fall).",Crown rot,,"Do not harvest any stalks during the first growing season so that your plants can become established. Harvest the stalks when they are 12 to 18 inches long. Usually after 3 years, the harvest period runs 8 to 10 weeks long. If the stalks become thin, stop harvesting; this means the plant's food reserves are low. Grab the base of the stalk and pull it away from the plant with a gentle twist. If this doesn't work, you can cut the stalk at the base. Be sure the discard of the leaves! Always leave at least 2 stalks per plant to ensure continued production. You may have a bountiful harvest for up to 20 years without having to replace your rhubarb plants.",
29,Spinach,"This super-cold-hardy vegetable is a tender crop that can be planted in very early spring as well as fall and winter. Spinach has similar growing conditions and requirements as lettuce, but it is more versatile in both its nutrition and its ability to be eaten raw or cooked. It is higher in iron, calcium, and vitamins than most cultivated greens, and one of the best sources of vitamins A, B, and C.",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),"Loamy, Neutral pH","Prepare the soil with compost about a week before planting, or, you may wish to prepare your spot in the fall so that you can sow the seeds outdoors in early spring as soon as the ground thaws.

Harvest by pinching outer leaves at their base.  Don’t wait too long to harvest, or wait for larger leaves; bitterness will set in quickly after maturity.",
30,Summer Squash,"Squash is a seasonal vegetable. It is very susceptible to frost and heat damage, but with proper care it will produce a bumper crop with very few plants. There are many varieties of summer squash to choose from, including zucchini. The main difference between winter and summer varieties is their harvest time; the longer growing period gives winter squash a tougher, inedible skin",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),Loamy,"If you wish to start seeds indoors due to a short gardening season, sow 2 to 4 weeks before last spring frost in peat pots. However, we recommend direct-seeding for squash because they do not always transplant well. If you do transplant, be very gentle with the roots. The outside planting site needs to receive full sun; the soil should be moist and well-drained, but not soggy. Squash plants are heavy feeders. Work compost and plenty of organic matter into the soil before planting for a rich soil base.","The soil needs to be warm (at least 60º at a two-inch depth) so we plant summer squash after our spring crops of peas, lettuce, and spinach—about one week after the last spring frost to midsummer.  In fact, waiting to plant a few seeds in midsummer will help avoid problems from vine borers and other pests and diseases common earlier in the season.","Plant seeds about one-inch deep and 2 to 3 feet apart in a traditional garden bed. Or, you could also plant as a “hill” of 3 or 4 seeds sown close together on a small mound; this is helpful in northern climates as the soil is warmer off the ground. Allow 4 to 6 feet between hills.",Transplanting summer squash is not recommended.,Final plant spacing should be around 4-6 feet apart in all directions.,"For all type of squash, frequent and consistent watering is recommended. Water most diligently when fruits form and throughout their growth period. Water deeply once a week, applying at least one inch of water. Do not water shallowly; the soil needs to be moist 4 inches down.","When the first blooms appear, apply a small amount of fertilizer as a side dress application.

33,Watermelon,"Everyone seems to love juicy watermelon in the summertime. Native to Africa, melons need warm temperatures (up to 80 degrees during the day) and a long growing season. Gardeners in colder climates can still have success in growing watermelon by starting seeds indoors and choosing short-season varieties. Days to maturity range from 70 to 90, depending on the variety.",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),Loamy,"Amend soil with aged manure, seaweed, and/or compost before planting. Watermelons are heavy feeders. Watermelons prefer a soil pH between 6 and 6.8.","Watermelon vines are very tender and should not be transplanted until all danger of frost has passed. (To be safe, wait at least two weeks past your last frost date.) If you are in a cooler zone, start seeds indoors about a month before transplanting.","If you live in warmer climates, you can direct sow seeds outdoors, but wait until the soil temperature warms to at least 70 degrees to avoid poor germination.","Transplant at least two weeks past the last frost date of spring.  After you transplant, cover the plants with row covers to keep pests at bay. You'll remove the row covers when you see both male and female flowers on the vine.","Growing the vines in raised rows, known as hills, ensures good drainage and will hold the sun’s heat longer. Space the plants about 2 feet apart in a 5-foot-wide hill. If you're growing in rows, space 6 feet apart by 6 feet apart. ","Watering is very important from planting until fruit begins to form. While melon plants are growing, blooming, and setting fruit, they need 1 to 2 inches of water per week. Keep soil moist but not waterlogged. Water at the vine's base in the morning, and try to avoid wetting the leaves and avoid overhead watering. Reduce watering once fruit are growing. Dry weather produces the sweetest melon.","If you choose to fertilize (and many do), make sure it's deliver more nitrogen than phosphorus and potassium. However, after flowering begins, use a fertilizer with less nitrogen. We like to use liquid seaweed.","Mulching with black plastic will serve multiple purposes: it will warm the soil, hinder weed growth and keep developing fruits clean. Pruning isn't necessary, but vine productivity may be improved if you do not allow lateral (side) vines to grow and stick to the main vine. When the plant is young, just cut off the end buds as they form (before the side shoots become vines). You can also pinch off some blossoms to focus the energy on fewer melons (though it's a challenge to kill off a potential fruit!). As fruit is ripening, prevent rotting by gently lifting it and putting some cardboard or straw between the fruit and the soil.","Aphids, Squash Borers",Fusarium Wilt,"Watermelons don’t sweeten after they are picked, so harvest time is important. They generally ripen over two weeks so keep you eye on them. Check the tendril. If it's green, wait. If it’s half-dead, the watermelon is nearly ripe or ripe. If the tendril is fully dead, it's ripe or overripe; it’s not going to get any riper, so you might as well pick! Stems should be cut with a sharp knife close to the fruit.","Watermelons can be stored uncut for about 10 days. If cut, they can last in the refrigerator for about 4 days. Wrap tightly in plastic."
34,Winter Squash,"Squash is a seasonal vegetable. It is very susceptible to frost and heat damage, but with proper care it will produce a bumper crop with very few plants. There are many varieties of summer squash to choose from, including zucchini. The main difference between winter and summer varieties is their harvest time; the longer growing period gives winter squash a tougher, inedible skin",Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day),Loamy,"If you wish to start seeds indoors due to a short gardening season, sow 2 to 4 weeks before last spring frost in peat pots. However, we recommend direct-seeding for squash because they do not always transplant well. If you do transplant, be very gentle with the roots. The outside planting site needs to receive full sun; the soil should be moist and well-drained, but not soggy. Squash plants are heavy feeders. Work compost and plenty of organic matter into the soil before planting for a rich soil base.","The soil needs to be warm (at least 60º at a two-inch depth) so we plant summer squash after our spring crops of peas, lettuce, and spinach—about one week after the last spring frost to midsummer.  In fact, waiting to plant a few seeds in midsummer will help avoid problems from vine borers and other pests and diseases common earlier in the season.","Plant seeds about one-inch deep and 2 to 3 feet apart in a traditional garden bed. Or, you could also plant as a “hill” of 3 or 4 seeds sown close together on a small mound; this is helpful in northern climates as the soil is warmer off the ground. Allow 4 to 6 feet between hills.",Transplanting winter squash is not recommended.,Final plant spacing should be around 4-6 feet apart in all directions.,"For all type of squash, frequent and consistent watering is recommended. Water most diligently when fruits form and throughout their growth period. Water deeply once a week, applying at least one inch of water. Do not water shallowly; the soil needs to be moist 4 inches down.","When the first blooms appear, apply a small amount of fertilizer as a side dress application. After harvest begins, fertilize occasionally for vigorous growth and lots of fruits.","Mulch plants to protect shallow roots, discourage weeds, and retain moisture.",Blossom End Rot,"Squash Borer, Squash Bug, Aphids, Stink bug","Harvest winter squash when rind is hard and deep in color, usually late September through October.","Winter squash can be stored in a cool, dark place until needed.
